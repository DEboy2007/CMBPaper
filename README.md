# CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool

These notebooks are based on code Jeff McMahon prepared for the 2015 La Serena data science summer school for the CMB Analysis Summer School held at the University of Michigan. The code is expanded upon specifically to experiment with the effects of curvature on various cosmological properties. I created code to visualize and contrast the curved and flat universes' power spectrums and sky maps, test different noise parameters and types and their effects on CMB maps, create different apodizing windows, analyze different ACT patches, and visualize polarizations.
